    <!-- In Electron with nodeIntegration, we can require modules directly if needed,

    <!-- We need a bundler in a real app, but for this 'simple' structure without Webpack/Vite config 
         explicitly requested, we might hit issues with JSX. 
         Wait, user asked to "create folders and create files". 
         I will assume standard CRA-like structure or manual setup? 
         Given the request "create files", I will assume we are NOT running a bundler yet.
         HOWEVER, writing raw JSX in Electron without a build step won't work easily.
         
         To make this actually runnable easily without complex build steps, 
         I will use Babel standalone for in-browser transpilation OR assume the user will run a build.
         
         Let's stick to the Plan: "Setup Electron + React Environment".
         The best way is to assume a standard build (Vite/Webpack).
         But since I didn't create a vite.config.js, let's create a minimal vite config 
         OR just write standard file structure and assume a modern runtime.
         
         Actually, the previous package.json didn't have vite. 
         Let me update package.json to include vite for a smooth dev experience.
